# UEFA PostgreSQL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes UEFA competition data using PostgreSQL to answer a wide range of football-related analytical questions. The datasets include Goals, Matches, Players, Teams, and Stadiums, enabling detailed insights into player performance, team results, match statistics, and stadium trends.

## Goals of the Project
Analyze UEFA competition data from multiple CSV sources to generate insights on players, teams, goals, matches, and stadiums. The aim was to answer specific analytical questions using advanced SQL queries to understand performance trends and key statistics in European football.

## Process
- Loaded five datasets (Goals, Matches, Players, Stadiums, Teams) into PostgreSQL.
- Performed data cleaning and preparation.
- Applied SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries.
- Designed analytical queries for single-table and cross-table insights to address predefined football-related questions.

## Features
- Identify top goal scorers and assist providers by season.
- Analyze match results, draws, penalty shootouts, and attendance trends.
- Evaluate team performance metrics and stadium usage.
- Detailed player profiles, positions, and performance statistics.
- Cross-table insights like highest-attended matches, capacity-based performance trends, and win distributions by country.

## Tools & Technologies
